This library supports Graphical LCD (GLCD) displays for use with Arduino and other AVR controllers

This library is the updated version of the arduino ks0108 library by Michael Margolis. Michael has teamed up with Bill Perry to produce a new version of the library with many new features. Highlights include support for additional glcd chips, support for all Arduino print methods, user definable scrolling text areas, as well as a new method of configuring i/o pins that is much simpler and allows any AVR pin to be assigned to any glcd hardware pin.

# NOTICE #
This library is no longer being maintained by the authors and has not been updated
since December 2011.
This library does not work with newer Arduino IDEs like the latest 1.0.x releases
as well as 1.6.0 IDE and beyond since the newer IDEs use
updated AVR gcc tools and GLCDv3 library uses
code which is not compatible with the newer AVR gcc tools.

If you are ok with a GPL 3.0 licensed library (your project is open source)
openGLCD is an alternative which is compatible with GLCDv3 and is being maintained.

u8glib is another alternative and is licensed under the new bsd license:
